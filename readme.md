# **Facial Recognition using OpenCV and DeepFace**

## **Overview**

This project showcases a simple facial recognition system integrating OpenCV for computer vision and DeepFace for deep learning-based face recognition. The application captures video frames from a camera, leverages OpenCV for face detection, and utilizes DeepFace for face recognition.
